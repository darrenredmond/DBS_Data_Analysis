  Output: "Welcome to Lesson 2! In this lesson, we will learn what DISPERSION is and
    what statistical values are needed in order to best describe the spread of data.
    Further, you will learn all about a box-and-whisker plot which is  a plot commonly
    used by statisticians when determining variability."

- Class: text
  Output: "While measures of central tendency are used to estimate the middle values
    of a dataset, measures of dispersion are important for describing the spread of
    the data."

- Class: text
  Output: "The term dispersion refers to degree to which the data values are scattered
    around an average value. Dispersion is synonymous with other words such as variability
    and spread."

- Class: text
  Output: "Why is it important to analyze the spread of a particular set of data?
    Two different samples may have the same mean or median, but different levels of
    variability or vice versa."
